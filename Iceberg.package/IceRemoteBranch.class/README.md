Models a remote tracking branch.

Please note that a "remote tracking" branch is in fact in the local repository, but it is not intended to work on it, but just to mirror a branch in a remote repository. You can not really checkout this branch, neither commit on it, it is read only.

When cheking out a branch, if it is a remote tracking branch, a local branch will be created.
