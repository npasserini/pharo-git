I am the syncronizer window. 
I am called to perform any of the basic operations of iceberg: 

- commit (save changes)
- update (load new changes from incomming commit versions)
- publish (send to central repository local commits)

usually I'm called from the repositories browser, when selecting the "syncronize" option from contextual menu.
