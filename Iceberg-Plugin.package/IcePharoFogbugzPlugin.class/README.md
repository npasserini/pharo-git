I'm a pluging to handle fogbugz issues integration. 
It just add options to easily handle the creation of branchs with the "convention" issue naming format (number-plus-normalised-title): 

12345-a-sample-of-issue-branch

NOTE: In the future we can add other fogbugz elements (like list issues, etc.), but since API is very slow we will consider it very carefully.
